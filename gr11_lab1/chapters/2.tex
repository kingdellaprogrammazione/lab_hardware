To verify the correctness of the manual calculations, the circuit was recreated on the online platform \textbf{Quirk} (\url{https://algassert.com/quirk}).
The following figure shows the circuit built in Quirk:

\end{figure}
From the \textit{State Vector Display} in Quirk, it can be observed that the final state of the system matches with the manually calculated result.
